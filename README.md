#Orbit

by Alexander Nguyen
Game Project for CMPS 4490 - Game Design

Step #1: git clone https://github.com/Ethereal15/Orbit on your Linux 
Step #2 Have all the necessary package
Step #3 make
Step #4 ./orbit
Step #5 Play,   Button 1-3 above next to tilda (~) shoots an orb at the planet

Init Goal (Complete):
The orb is shot at the planet which will force the planet to move due to the gravity influence on the orb and goal is to knock the other two planets. You can only move a certain range up and down direction, and only have 3 chances. 

Mid Goal (Incomplete): 
If ever I continue on this or someone wish to continue my goal for this game, was to have more collision on the asteroid/moon that is orbiting around the planets to destory the orb if it ever collides.

Final Goal(Incomplete):
Have the orb be shot from the current position and have it fly around the planet with each planet influence it and the moon/asteroid destorying it if it ever hits and player goal is to shoot the orb to the designation completing the game. 


Due to little coding time to work on this project, I am satisfy of how my game came out using the X11 and OpenGL with no api set by my Professor.
